# Vamos (we go)

I swear, this is _the last go game I write_.

In 2014, I made [go-websocket](https://github.com/tlehman/go-websocket). Then in 2015 I made a rails version called [goga.me](https://github.com/tlehman/goga.me), and then in 2019 I started writing a version in rust, because why not: https://github.com/tlehman/gogame

This one will actually work. The only one that I actually got working over the internet was goga.me, but I never finished it.

I have been doing a lot of TypeScript and React at Amazon lately, deployed to the AWS cloud. I've been loving it, so the great Annual Go Game Rewrite will be done in TypeScript as a React app.
